Verifier is the class that needs to do verification.

To run:

1) first build using build.sh (on Linux) or just type the commands from it in Windows.
2) then run with run.sh

An eclipse project is also included, so you should be able to directly use it as well.


Do not forget to test with other examples - not only with Test1 and Test2.
